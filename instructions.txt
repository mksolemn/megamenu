Assessment Test Instructions
----------------------------

The task before you is to code the markup of a mega drop-down menu design using valid HTML5/CSS3.
The design is featured in the file named "mega-dropdown.png". It depicts a 'hover' state of the
"Products" menu item of some main navigation.  

1. Your main goal is to end up with a working version of this menu - a primary navigation that reveals 
a mega drop-down menu when the user hovers over the "Products" item. The menu should be positioned
center top of the viewport.

2. A secondary goal is for you to come up with a mobile responsive version of this navigation. No design
exists for the responsive state, so it will be up to you to decide which elements you need to include
there using today's mobile best practices. Keep it simple and mind the semantic markup.   



Additional points will be given:

-	if you enrich the menu with just the right amount of bling using CSS3 transitions/animations :) 


Other notes: 

-	All of the required imagery is located in the "assets" folder, but it is up to you to decide 
	whether or not you need to modify it, for example constructing a sprite etc.

-	For the desktop version, the markup should be compatible with IE9+

-	As far as mobile goes, our team will check the markup using Chrome dev tools in mobile mode
 	set to iPhone 6 and iPad, so there is absolutely no need to go overboard with the responsive version. 

-	Since you'll be working with a preview file instead of Photoshop project files, 
	pixel perfection (in regards to correct font sizes, colors, dimensions etc.) is not imperative, 
	but we do expect you to keep it as close as possible.

-	The fonts being used belong to the Open Sans family and are freely available online. 
	Choose any of the available embedding options and use this font family in the assessment.

-	Should you require any JavaScript in the assessment, please keep to vanilla JS only. 


Good luck!
