# megamenu
<h1>Mega menu using Vanillajs HTML5, CSS3 flexbox</h1>
<p>
This is pretty responsive megamenu, should work with all screen sized.
It was built using flexbox, to keep menu menu spread through the entire top navigation bar.
Also flexbox is used for the columns in the navigation, it wasn't necessary, but I wanted to
avoid using media queries as much as possible.
